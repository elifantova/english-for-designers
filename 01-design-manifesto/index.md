# Design Manifesto 

- In graphic design, clarity for the audience should always be a primary objective. While the use of metaphors and creative elements can enhance a design, it is crucial that the core message remains clear and aligns with its intended function.

- Each project presents a unique opportunity, and designs should be tailored to meet the specific needs and preferences of clients. Approaching every assignment with a blank slate allows for fresh creativity, ensuring that the final product resonates with the client's vision.
  
- Functionality is paramount; a design must effectively fulfill its purpose. If it fails to engage the audience or communicate its message, it cannot be considered successful.

- Great design should be a balance of timelessness, innovation, and visual appeal. Striving for this balance helps create memorable and relevant work that endures over time.

- Collaboration can be equally rewarding, whether working in a team or independently. Collaborating brings diverse perspectives that can enhance creativity, while individual projects allow for personal expression and a unique vision.

- Effective communication with clients is vital. Listening to their wants and needs while maintaining your boundaries as a designer is essential. This dynamic ensures that the designer’s expertise shapes the design while honoring the client’s vision.
  
- Finally, every designer has a unique style that should be integrated into their work. Clients often choose designers based off of their distinct aesthetic, so aligning personal style with client expectations is key to a successful partnership.
