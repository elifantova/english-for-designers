# Design Manifesto 

- In the case of graphic design, it should strive to be clear to the audience. It can use certain metaphors to enrich the design, however the function and point it serves, should always be clear. 
- For every project, the design should be different. It depends on what the client wants. Even though I have my own style, when it comes to a design manifesto which contains points about how something should look, I have no specific guidelines. I always go into each project with a clean slate. 
- The design of something depends on the function it serves. If it does not fulfill its function and the everyday viewer does not understand it, it is not a good design. 
- The design of something should be timeless, innovative, eyecatching and functional.
- Design can be a group effort, as well as individual. When working on a project with multiple people, it can bring so many different ideas and views, which can result in a dynamic design. This however, is also possible when working individually.
- Communication is key - specifically communication with the client. It is important to truly listen to their wants and needs when it comes to design. However, it is also important to keep your own boundaries as a designer, as you have the experience with what is visually appealing. You have to work with their assignments and your personal style. Why would they want to employ you, if they do not like your work?
