  - Each of these examples effectively convey what I aim to communicate as a designer. They are straightforward and focused, clearly outlining their areas of expertise and professional experience. Importantly, they highlight who they are as designers rather than focusing on personal interests outside of work. While understanding a designerâ€™s personality and compatibility is valuable, I believe these concise and well-crafted descriptions subtly reflect that as well. They are professional, to the point, and serve their purpose effectively.

Bio:
  - I am a Czech graphic design student focusing on book design, illustrations, and visual identities. I have an interest in clean, yet captivating and colourful design that emphasises clarity and impact. My work prioritises functionality and aesthetics, aiming to create designs that effectively communicate the intended message.
