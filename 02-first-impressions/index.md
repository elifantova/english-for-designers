  - Each of these examples effectively convey what I aim to communicate as a designer. They are straightforward and focused, clearly outlining their areas of expertise and professional experience. Importantly, they highlight who they are as designers rather than focusing on personal interests outside of work. While understanding a designer’s personality and compatibility is valuable, I believe these concise and well-crafted descriptions subtly reflect that as well. They are professional, to the point, and serve their purpose effectively.

# Featured projects:

## 1. [Czech Tennis](02-czech-tennis/index.md)
2024 | Visual identity | Class workshop

As part of an atelier workshop, where we were given the task of creating a sports campaign for Czech Tennis. In our visual communication, we work with a "brush", which resembles the texture of the tennis court floors, since it is specifically characteristic of the sport in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, we chose to use a typographical logo with a green dot above the i to imitate the look of a tennis ball. 



## 2. [FamuFest 40](02-famufest-40/index.md) + [FamuFest 41](02-famufest-41/index.md)
2023/2024 | Visual identity 


![att awtKFSpOH3pbTWz5Kgyb9cDELq3te7f0kqW4D3K5Nb8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/689b0180-db32-4602-9e18-f0631f89cf51)


Two proposals for the visual identity of a student film festival in Prague, created and organised by FAMU. Themes: FamuFest 40 - Networks (we chose to focus our visual identity on neurons, to compliment the theme), FamuFest 41 - Happy End (we worked with video cassets and mainly emphasised the theme with captions, which objectively display a classic happy ending in movies). Our proposal for FamuFest 41 got into the second round of the admission process.


## 3. [Café and Club Letka](02-cafe-klub-letka/index.md)

The proposals for the redesign of a café and club located in Prague. Our team worked with the concept, which was inspired by the café's original logo, and consisted of streams of typography immitating the condensation trails left behind by planes.
