### Happy end
2025 | Visual identity 

For the 41st FAMUFEST, our team created a visual identity reflecting the festival’s theme, "Happy End," which explores the iconic conclusion of storytelling — the moment when everything comes together. We chose film cassettes as the central motif, symbolising both the technical and artistic legacy of cinema.

Film cassettes evoke nostalgia for a time when stories were linear, and media was more cherished, reminding us of the slower, more deliberate pace of the past. This reference underscores the festival’s theme, celebrating not just film, but a return to simpler times when endings were seen as happy conclusions, not just closed chapters.

#### How our team approached this design? 

Our main objective was to represent nostalgia and a linear form of time, which is mainly present in films. This choice led us to focus on the simplicity and warmth of past media experiences, capturing the slower, more deliberate pace of filmmaking. By incorporating film cassettes, we aimed to connect the festival’s theme to a return to a simpler, more nostalgic time, where endings were celebrated as happy conclusions rather than just the closing of chapters.
