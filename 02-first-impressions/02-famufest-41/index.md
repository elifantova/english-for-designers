# Happy end
For the 41st iteration of FAMUFEST, the student film festival held by the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts (FAMU), our team was tasked with designing a visual identity that reflects both the celebratory nature of the festival and the overarching theme: "Happy End." This theme invites exploration of storytelling’s most iconic and universally relatable conclusion — the moment when everything comes together and reaches resolution.

To visually express this concept, our team chose to incorporate film cassettes as a central motif. Film cassettes, a nostalgic symbol of the film industry’s past, became the perfect representation of the medium's enduring legacy. These cassettes evoke both the technical and artistic side of cinema, reminding us of the tactile experience of filmmaking and the power of storytelling through the lens of film history.

This nostalgic medium takes us back to a time when stories were linear and information came at a rate we determined ourselves. Videotapes transport us to an era when time passed differently and when all news, movies or information were not always within reach. It was a time when we cherished the individual moments that the media brought us and when stories managed to stay in our memory longer and deeper. Therefore, the selection of videotapes perfectly underlines this year's concept of Famufest, which is a reference to the simplicity that we have lost over time. This festival is not only a celebration of film, but also a return to our own inner self - to a time when we could perceive the end of a story as a happy conclusion, not just another closed chapter.
