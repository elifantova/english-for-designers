### Happy end
2025
For the 41st FAMUFEST, our team created a visual identity reflecting the festival’s theme, "Happy End," which explores the iconic conclusion of storytelling — the moment when everything comes together. We chose film cassettes as the central motif, symbolising both the technical and artistic legacy of cinema.

Film cassettes evoke nostalgia for a time when stories were linear, and media was more cherished, reminding us of the slower, more deliberate pace of the past. This reference underscores the festival’s theme, celebrating not just film, but a return to simpler times when endings were seen as happy conclusions, not just closed chapters.
