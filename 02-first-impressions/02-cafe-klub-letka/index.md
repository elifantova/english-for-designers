# Redefining Club and Café Letka

The proposals for the redesign of a café and club located in Prague represent a creative and thoughtful approach to blending modern design with the venue's unique identity. Our team was tasked with developing a concept that not only reimagined the physical space but also honored the café's original logo. Drawing inspiration from this logo, we decided to explore a visual theme that reflected movement, energy, and an air of sophistication. The concept evolved around streams of typography that mimicked the condensation trails left behind by airplanes soaring through the sky. This metaphor for fluidity and travel was infused throughout the design, aiming to evoke feelings of adventure, exploration, and connection.

The typography itself was carefully crafted to emulate the sleek, ephemeral quality of contrails, with each letter flowing seamlessly into the next, creating a sense of continuous motion. This dynamic design element was integrated into various aspects of the café and club’s redesign, from the signage to the interior decor, enhancing the overall atmosphere with a sense of movement and modernity. By incorporating the fluidity of these trails, the space was transformed into a dynamic environment where energy and creativity converge, offering a visually striking yet inviting space for patrons to enjoy.
