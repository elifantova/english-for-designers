# Redefining Café and Club Letka

The proposals for the redesign of a café and club located in Prague represent a creative and thoughtful approach to blending modern design with the venue's unique identity. Our team was tasked with developing a concept, which not only reimagined the physical space, but also honored the café's original logo. Drawing inspiration from this logo, we decided to explore a visual theme that reflected movement and energy due to the theme of the café (flying). The concept evolved around streams of typography, which mimicked the condensation trails left behind by airplanes soaring through the sky. This metaphor for fluidity and travel was infused throughout the design, aiming to evoke feelings of adventure, exploration, and connection.

The typography itself was carefully crafted to emulate the sleek, ephemeral quality of contrails, with each letter flowing seamlessly into the next, creating a sense of continuous motion. This dynamic design element was integrated into various aspects of the café and club’s redesign, from the signage to the merchandise, enhancing the overall atmosphere with a sense of movement and modernity. 

Furthermore, the thematics and visual identity of the café were expected to be aligned with that of the club, where we chose to differentiate the style by using more rigidly looking contrails, as well as using the dissimilar components of the club logo (- instead of .).
