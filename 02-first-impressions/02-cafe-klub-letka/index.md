# Redefining Café and Club Letka

Our redesign of Café and Club Letka in Prague blends modern design with the venue’s unique identity. We were inspired by the café’s original logo and its flying theme, creating a visual concept that reflects movement and energy. The design features typography that mimics airplane contrails, symbolising fluidity, adventure, and connection.

This flowing typography is seen throughout the space, from signage to merchandise, giving the café and club a sense of continuous motion. To set the café and club apart, we used more rigid contrails and different elements in the club’s logo, creating distinct but connected identities for each space.
