### Redefining Café and Club Letka
2024 | Visual identity | Class workshop

Our redesign of Café and Club Letka in Prague blends modern design with the venue’s unique identity. We were inspired by the café’s original logo and its flying theme, creating a visual concept that reflects movement and energy. The design features typography that mimics airplane contrails, symbolising fluidity, adventure, and connection.

This flowing typography is seen throughout the space, from signage to merchandise, giving the café and club a sense of continuous motion. To set the café and club apart, we used more rigid contrails and different elements in the club’s logo, creating distinct but connected identities for each space.

#### How our team approached this design? 

Designing a visual identity for a café in combination with a club was also a new challenge, however it was much closer to what we have done before. Our design team approached the Café and Club Letka redesign by blending modern design with the venue’s unique flying theme, as well as its interior design. Inspired by the original logo, we used typography resembling airplane contrails to symbolise movement and energy. This flowing design appears throughout the space, from signage to merchandise.

To create distinct identities for each space, we applied more rigid contrails in the club’s logo, while keeping the café’s design more fluid, offering a dynamic yet cohesive experience.

#### Key aspects of our design: 

- typographic contrails
- neutral/pastel colour palette for the café
- brighter colour palette for the club
- rigid vs. rounded contrails
- typographic logos
