# Revitalizing Czech Tennis

### 2024 | Visual identity | Class workshop
---

In an attempt to refresh and expand our idea of graphic design, we were presented with the thrilling challenge of designing a captivating sports campaign for Czech Tennis. Our goal was to capture the passion of the sport while appealing to a modern audience. Our design centers around a 'brush' motif inspired by the unique texture of Czech tennis courts, reflecting the ball’s movement and the court's colors.

The playful yet clean typographic logo features a green dot above the ‘i’, echoing the look of a tennis ball. This simple touch keeps the design focused and clear while complementing the dynamic brush strokes, making it instantly recognizable and full of energy for both casual fans and tennis enthusiasts.

A part of our merchandise, we decided to design merch, which had connotations to sports - thus the duffle bag.
