# Shaping a bold new look for FAMUFEST 40 

For the 40th anniversary of FAMUFEST, the student film festival held by the prestigious Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts (FAMU), our team was tasked with creating a visual identity that would celebrate both the milestone and the festivalâ€™s role in shaping the future of cinema. The central theme for the 40th edition was "Networks," a concept, which emphasises the interconnectedness of ideas, people, and the creative exchange within the world of filmmaking. 

Drawing inspiration from this theme, we chose to explore the intricate and dynamic nature of neural networks as the foundation for the design. Neurons, as the building blocks of complex networks, symbolise the flow of information, creativity, and collaborative elements, which define both the festival and the cinematic process. By using neural networks as the visual motif, we aimed to convey the idea of connectivity. The design features a network of stylised neurons, interconnected by intricate lines, pathways and sometimes even typography, symbolizing the vast web of connections that FAMUFEST has fostered over four decades.
