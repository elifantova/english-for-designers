### Shaping a bold new look for FAMUFEST 40 
2024 | Visual identity | Class workshop

For FAMUFEST's 40th anniversary, our team created a visual identity, which celebrated the festival’s milestone and its impact on cinema. The theme "Networks" highlighted the interconnectedness of ideas, people, and creative exchange in filmmaking.

Inspired by this, we used neural networks as the design foundation. Stylised neurons symbolised the flow of creativity and collaboration, with intricate lines and pathways — sometimes incorporating typography — to represent the connections FAMUFEST has fostered over four decades.

#### How our team approached this design? 

Since this festival had a set theme - "Networks" - our team decided to concentrate mainly on that. On one hand, there were the problematics of how to represent "Networks" and on the other, what else our representation of the theme would further suggest. We decided to take it realistically and created colourful illustrations of neurons, with which we sometimes combined with drawn typography. Due to these illustrations, we wanted to create the rest of the visual identity in a very simple manner.
